# Streamlining `ssh` Configuration

In `~/.ssh/config`, I added these lines using Vim in the command-line. To edit a file using Vim, I opened Vim using the command `vim ~/.ssh/config`, then typed `i` to insert text. After typing in the lines below, I pressed the escape key, then typed `:wq` to save and exit the file.

```
Host ieng6
	HostName ieng6.ucsd.edu
	User cs15lsp22acw
```

This allows me to access the ieng6 remote server by simply typing `ssh ieng6`.

To copy a file from my local machine to the remote server, I typed `scp test-file.md ieng6:~/`. Normally, I would have had to type my username `cs15lsp22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` in place of `ieng6`.

```
(base) jenny@Jennys-MacBook-Air-2 markdown-parser % scp test-file.md ieng6:~/
test-file.md                                  100%   64     1.4KB/s   00:00 
```

Using `ls` while logged into the remote server confirms that `test-file.md` was successfully copied over.

```
[cs15lsp22acw@ieng6-203]:~:97$ ls
WhereAmI.class  markdown-parser  skill-demo-2     test
WhereAmI.java   perl5            skill-demo-test  test-file.md
```

# Setting Up Github Access from `ieng6`

This is my public key on Github, which can be found in the "SSH and GPG" section of the Settings menu on Github.
![Github public key](../../img/lab3/github_key.png)

On my local computer, the public key is stored as `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.
![User account public key](../../img/lab3/public_key_local.png)

My private key is stored in `~/.ssh` as `id_rsa`.
![Private key](../../img/lab3/private_key.png)

Then, on the remote server, I created a file called `delete-this-file.md` using `touch`, then committed and pushed my changes onto Github.

```
[cs15lsp22acw@ieng6-203]:markdown-parser:105$ touch delete-this-file.md
[cs15lsp22acw@ieng6-203]:markdown-parser:106$ git add .
[cs15lsp22acw@ieng6-203]:markdown-parser:107$ git commit -m "Created delete-this-file.md"
